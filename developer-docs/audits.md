# Security & Audits

The iHelp Protocol smart contracts are being developed with security at the forefront of the various design and development decisions. The goal of the Protocol with regards to security is to provide complete dependability to our contributors, charities and the broader ecosystem engaging with the system.

### Security Audits

iHelp intends to complete a rigorous assessment of the smart contracts in the first half of 2022. Development of these contracts if following best practices to the extent possible, especially those as outlined and maintained by [ConsenSys Diligence](https://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/).

### Vulnerability Policy

Even with such priority and maximum effort, there is still the possibility that vulnerabilities can exist. In case you discover a vulnerability, we would like to know about it immediately so we can take steps to address it as quickly as possible.

If you discover a vulnerability, please do the following:

```
E-mail your findings to security@ihelp.finance 

Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or similar problems you have discovered, including, but not limited to, testing the vulnerability on the Ethereum mainnet or testnet. 

Do not reveal the vulnerability to others until it has been resolved, including, but not limited to, filing a public ticket mentioning the vulnerability. 

Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the vulnerability, so we will be able to resolve it as quickly as possible. Complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation so we might ask you for additional information. 
```
