# Distribution Phases

There are 10 distinct phases of 1,000,000 HELP tokens each, for a total of 10,000,000 HELP tokens to be distributed to donors as a reward for donating yield through the protocol.&#x20;

The amount of yield required to receive one HELP token increases by 2x in each phase (see table below). In Phase 1 users will receive one HELP token for every $0.60 of yield donated to charities. In Phase 2, the yield donation requirement to receive one HELP token doubles to $1.20.

The IHELP protocol tracks the total sum of yield donated to all charities measured in USD employing a Chainlink Oracle.

&#x20;The community will be able to accelerate or slow down the emissions rate of user rewards/incentives via a governance vote. The total number of tokens to distribute via rewards is fixed and cannot be modified.

Below you will find the detailed distribution schedule by phase at the protocol's launch.
