# Introduction

Anyone that donates **yield** to charities via the IHELP protocol will receive HELP reward tokens.

While contributing to a cause is a noble and meaningful reward by itself, we seek to create a robust and sustainable ecosystem with specific key incentives and programmed allocation of resources that will help the protocol become a thriving ecosystem with a global donor community.&#x20;

In order to achieve the aforementioned goals, 10 million HELP tokens (50% of total supply) will be distributed via rewards to yield donors. The rate at which these tokens will be distributed is described in the [Distribution Phases](distribution-phases.md) section. The rate at which the tokens are distributed to yield donors can be modified at any point via a [governance](../governance.md) vote.&#x20;

Helpers that receive HELP tokens can [stake](staking-pool.md) them and receive periodic staking rewards as described in the [Donation Distribution](../donation-distribution.md) section.
