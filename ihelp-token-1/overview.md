# Allocations

The HELP tokenâ€™s purpose will be to **** incentivize donors to use the platform, and contribute to the long-term success of the network.&#x20;

The HELP token will be a fixed-supply ERC-20 token. Supply is capped at 20,000,000 HELP tokens.&#x20;

**10,000,000 HELP (50%)**: Pre-mined tokens distributed to the IHELP DAO. These tokens will be used for fundraising, protocol improvement grants, CEX/DEX liquidity, advisors & founders, as well as a long term reserve for the IHELP DAO. The pre-mined tokens will remain in the IHELP DAO treasury until details are provided on how the tokens will be allocated.&#x20;

**10,000,000 HELP (50%)**: Reserved as reward tokens for donors to who donate yield through the protocol. The token award calculation will be based on the amount of yield donated by the donor. The token award ratio is split into 10 phases based on the amount of yield generated, with specific step downs. Please refer to the [Distribution Phases](distribution-phases.md) section to learn more. The total amount of tokens to distribute to the community as rewards cannot be changed via governance. However, the rate at which tokens are distributed to users as an incentive/reward can be modified via a governance vote.&#x20;
