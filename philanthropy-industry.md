# Philanthropy Industry

$600 billion was donated to charities globally in 2020. $450 billion was donated to charities in the United States alone. Out of the $450 billion, individuals conform the largest segment of donors with total of $309 billion (69% share) donated. At the institutional level, foundations contributed $75 billion (17%), bequests $43 billion (10%) & corporations $21 billion (5%).&#x20;

Total charitable giving grew 5.1% in 2020 measured in current dollars over the revised total of $448.66 billion contributed in 2019. Adjusted for inflation, total giving increased 3.8%. 2020 was the highest year of charitable giving on record.&#x20;

Charitable giving can accelerate the adoption of crypto and make it a force for good in the world. The iHelp protocol leverages off blockchain tech and the DeFi ecosystem to deliver increased transparency, lower overhead and customer acquisition costs to charities, and involve a truly global and borderless audience in the effort to make the world a better place.

&#x20;There is growing interest in channeling some of the wealth that’s been created in cryptocurrency to good causes, and that extends beyond donations from individuals.
